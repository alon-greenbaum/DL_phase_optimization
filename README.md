# Intelligent Beam Optimization for Light-Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy through Deep Learning
Here we report that a joint-optimization continuously updates the phase mask and resulting in improved image quality for better cell detection. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated through both simulations and experiments, revealing substantial enhancements in imaging quality compared to traditional Gaussian light sheet. We discuss how designing microscopy systems through a computational approach provides novel insights for advancing optical design that relies on deep learning models for the analysis of imaging datasets.
