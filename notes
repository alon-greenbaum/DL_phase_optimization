propogate the axicon in free space and see what it looks like
propogate the ring that forms after the lens and see if it interefers to form the axicon

now measure the fwhm at the focal point of the slm with a fresnel lens and then use an empty gaussian and calculate the fwhm of the gaussian after a lens. Th

Also be sure that the fwhm is changing as a function of the gaussian beam equation

There is a trade off between the pixel size and the field of view

now check whether the fresnel convolution approach increases the pixel size in the output planes
