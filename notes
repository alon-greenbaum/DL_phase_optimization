propogate the axicon in free space and see what it looks like
propogate the ring that forms after the lens and see if it interferes to form a bessel

now measure the fwhm at the focal point of the slm with a fresnel lens and then use an empty gaussian and calculate the fwhm of the gaussian after a lens.

Also be sure that the fwhm is changing as a function of the gaussian beam equation

There is a trade off between the pixel size and the field of view

Also check whether the fresnel convolution approach increases the pixel size in the output planes

understand where the fresnel approx holds

see why the angula spectrum is producing different focusing

see the fwhm of the beam at the focal plane and beyond

demagnify the bessel beam and measure the non diffracting zone

see the effects of the non diffracting region of the bessel beam
